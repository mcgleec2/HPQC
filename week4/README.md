Week 4 Practical

Program Tracking:
Part 1:
Step 1:
comm_test_mpi.c = PHY1090/week4 original program
Step 2:
comm_test_mpi1.c = Functionlised program 
Step 3:
comm_test_mpi1_S.c = Modified comm_test_mpi1.c to use MPI_Ssend()
comm_test_mpi1_B.c = Modified comm_test_mpi1.c to use MPI_Bsend()
comm_test_mpi1_R.c = Modified comm_test_mpi1.c to use MPI_Rsend()
comm_test_mpi1_I.c = Modified comm_test_mpi1.c to use MPI_Isend()
Part 2:
Step 1:
