# HPQC

Each week contains its own README.md file which documents & explains programs used and developed,
along with any results obtained.

I apologise for any incomplete programs and/or documentation and any below par code
within these folders. Unfortunately, I find myself at the end of the year with many other CAs to do as
well, on top of thesis work and exam studying. I'm not saying this as an excuse,
just to say I recognise that some of these programs could certianly be improved upon and
more in-depth documnetation added, as well as my own time management being improved.
In any case, thank you for this module, it was certainly challenging but also quite interesting.
Thanks as well for your help in answering any questions throughout the semester.
